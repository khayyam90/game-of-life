    <h1>The game of life</h1>

    <div class="home">
        <p>Here is a presentation for this famous IT game.</p>
        
        <p>The game of life is a cell simulation where each cell can be alive or dead. On each iteration of the simulation, the status of all the cells is reconsidered against the following rules : 
            <ul>
                <li>An cell will live if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbours ;</li>
                <li>A dead cell will live if it has 3 alive neighbours.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These easy rules can be re-explained on biological ways such as : 
            <ul>
                <li>A cell with too much neighbours will not find enough energy to live : it will die ;</li>
                <li>An isolated cell will die : it needs the other cells.</li>
            </ul>
            The parameters in the rules (max / min neighbours) have a direct incidence to the global simulation and to the size of the living population. 
            Just request one more neighbour to get alive and you will lose almost your whole population. Just allow a cell to live with lower neighbours and you will face a population increasing until filling the entire simulation space.
        </p>

        <p>The simulation starts randomly and you will always notice some patterns : cells that do not move, cells that move together, cells that disappear together ...</p>
        <p>You can consider the simulation ended when you do not have more status changes or when you keep looping on the same status. Have a look at the population graph, it helps understanding population growth</p>

            <h2>Technical considerations</h2>
            <p>This online simulation is coded in 100% pure TypeScript. It does not need jQuery nor any other JS library. 
                VanillaJS is powerfull enough to allow dynamic and interactive content on client side. The standard HTML5 API correctly cover the features that made jQuery needed in the 2000's. 
                Time has gone and coders have to reconsider their dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>The CSS aspect could have been improved in removing the dependency with Bootstrap : importing the only very needed CSS blocks. I assumed that the CDN is fast enough and light enough not to burden the performances.</p>

                <div>After several simulations, you can exhib some special patterns. Some are stable and do not move anymore. Some are looping infinitely, some others are moving.</div>
